Ecological modeling of populations of organisms: There are complex interactions in nature and modeling of these interactions
help us understand how these numbers change over time or in relation to each other. In the past math has been used to explain 
population modeling. (wikipedia)

In my opinion ecological modeling of populations of organisms should be considered a bioinformatics research area since bioinfor
matic tools are used greatly in predictive ecology. For example, clustering can help in identifying the function of unknown 
genes. (PMCID: PMC3223807). Example- Zach Miller is (ecology and biology major, Yale Uni.) is using bioinformatics to study the
ways organisms interact and evolve together.Miller is using bioinformatics to develop a computer program that simulates organisms
in real world ecosystem (Eco-informatics)(http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2016/jul/REU073115.html).
