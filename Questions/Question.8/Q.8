1. Yes, there is a group in Metapopulation Research Centre,  University of Helsinki, Finland.

Another one in UK, http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=cinxia

2. LiSs (Linkage map Superscaffolder) for superscaffolding (unpublished). The group in Helsinki University is also planning to 
do more sequencing.

3.Several novel methods were developed and used in the Glanville fritillary butterfly genome project. These include-
a. Lep-MAP software for constructing accurate linkage maps using high-density SNP data (Rastas et al. 2013).
b. MIP Scaffolder for genome scaffolding (Salmela et al. 2012).
c. Coral and HybridSHREC for read error correction (Salmela and SchrË†der 2011; Salmela 2010).
d. PANNZER for functional annotation (Radivojac et al. 2013).
e. EPT and SANS for orthology prediction (Ta et al. 2011; Koskinen and Holm 2012).
f. Virtual Migration Model
g. Stochastic patch occupancy model- SPOMSIM 1.0
h. Simple connectivity model- Si
i. Testing for inequalities among loci- AnimalFarm ver 1.0
j. Validation of Phylogenetic trees from micro satellite data- MsatBootstrap ver1.1
k. RSA- Reserve Selection with Weights
l. MANAGE
m. PROTAX

4. Yes. NCBI has 58 scientific & medical abstract/citations, 143 full-text journal, 174 functional genomics studies, 
1 genome assembly, 209 DNA and RNA sequences, 344 high-throughput DNA and RNA sequences read archive, 205 protein sequences, 
13 bioactivity screening studies, 1 chemical info with structures, information and links and 12 deposited substance and 
chemical information.

5. 
By using dbSNP which is a free public archive to find SNPs within and across different species. 
Also by doing BLAST with other species of butterflies. 
There are many popular short-read alignment software like Bfast, BWA, MAQ etc which we can use for alignment.
For variant discovery (SNPs and Indels), GATK, SAM tools and FreeBayes.
Next gen for finding SNPs.
